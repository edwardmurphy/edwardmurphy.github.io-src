It's so fulfulling when expertise from hobbies pays off in unsuspecting ways. I was looking for a version of SAS I 
could install and use, fully expecting to (gasp!) resort to a "torrented" version. How excited I was when I discovered 
that SAS offers a free University Edition of its software...which uses Oracle VirtualBox! Only my favorite 
virtualization software. AND to top it off it comes with a kernel for Jupyter notebooks. My goodness. Still Christmas 
for me apparently.

Installation was cake. [Download] (http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html) the appliance, import 
it into VirtualBox, and open the web application in a browser on your host machine. Boom, you have SAS. Running 
virtually.

I have a deeper understanding now of the sorts of applications that are used in a virtual production environment. My 
use has always been rather limited to running multiple operating systems, while exploring the tip of the iceberg when 
it comes to server applications that this implies. Here is a full-fledged virtual product that has real impact for me. 
Of course I want to know all about how the appliance actually allows SAS to be run as a web application. Too frickin 
cool. 

Thanks SAS!
