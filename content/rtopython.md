One of my current hobbies (long since "in the works" but really just "in the brain") is collecting and refactoring all 
of my R code and writing the same code in Python. The main purpose of the refactoring my R code is to introduce myself 
to new libraries and functions in R, while also cleaning up code I wrote at the beginning of my R coding career. By 
rewriting these R scripts in Python, I can interactively and practically learn a new language. 

I'll be updating this post as progress is made, but for now the R code has been collected as is viewable in GitHub. 
The plan is to create a new repo for refactored R scripts and yet another repo for the corresponding Python scripts. 
I'll likely use IPython/Jupyter for the Python scripts to track my notes as I learn. I don't know if R code can be 
embedded in Jupyter notebooks, but if it can then perhaps I can save a step. 

Thanks for reading.

UPDATE: Yep, R can be run in Jupyter. Fun.
