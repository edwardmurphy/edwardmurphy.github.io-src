B.S., Neuroscience (Phi Beta Kappa) from the University of Pittsburgh. 

M.S., Statistics from San Diego State University.

Completed all the course work for a Ph.D. in Computational Science from Claremont Graduate University and San Diego 
State University, but stalled on the research part. Perhaps again one day...

Biostatistician, Statistical Programmer, Quality Engineer, Data Analyst, Biochemist with 15 years experience in the biotech industry. 

Born and raised in Delaware County, PA (adjacent to Philadelphia), with a few years in Ocean City, NJ where my love of the ocean was 
fully developed. Moved slightly west for college at the University of Pittsburgh. Moved further west after graduation to the city I now 
call home - San Diego, CA. Local status achieved.

Father of an amazing son who has taught me to keep growing. 

Hobbies include bodysurfing, reading, computer networking and software, computer programming, math anything, playing 
dominoes, and dancing. Rocking a beard and a chain on my wallet since before the hipsters.
