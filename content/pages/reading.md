[The Family Arsenal by Paul Theroux]({filename}/images/theroux.jpg)

Some good quotes:

"An accident had brought him here; but there were no accidents - instinct was offered expression by a hollowing of chance, and impulse 
seized it. You didn't choose, you were chosen, claimed by an impulse that knew more than wisdom did of pain." -pg. 22

"He had always hated public houses; they were dirty and uncongenial, the haunts of resignation, attracting men whose loneliness was not 
improved by their meeting one another. They talked inaccurately about the world, swapping cheerless opinions." -pg. 29

"It was all easy, and if there was blame it was in taking advantage of the simplicity of it. He had not known it would end like this, on 
a dimly lit path above Peckham. He had thought he would feel triumphant, but he was only angry and his fingers stank of error. It was 
furiously petty; the man was worth nothing; no one knew. But he was not sorry. The memory of a thing not done was worse than any deed. 
He had never wanted to go back, and now he had proved he couldn't." -pg. 35

"In winter it was tolerable; it had a bleakness Mr Gawber liked. The cold rain composed it, blew the newspapers into corners, restored 
the black shine to the street and kept the limpers indoors. Rain tidied it and gave London back some of her glamour, even some of her 
youth: the city was designed for grim weather, not crowds." -pg. 37

"Norah said, 'We'll have a good holiday, you'll see.' He hated the word. He didn't want a holiday's brief deception 
of well-being." -pg. 41
