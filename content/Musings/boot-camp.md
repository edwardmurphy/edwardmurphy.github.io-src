Title: Current Workout Routine
Date: 2017-01-15

For the past 6 months I've had a manual labor job that has kept me in fairly good shape - at least has prevented the 
formation of belly fat which I think for me is the first sign of poor fitness. I'll be starting an office job in a few 
days, and combined with a couple weeks off from my manual labor job I began to worry about this fitness level. How I'd 
maintain it knowing I'm not someone who can just start going to the gym on a routine basis.

Then I remembered that I was fortunate enough to receive some personal training of sorts for 2 months while in 
Riverside early in 2016. Three days a week, 20-25 minutes of boot camp style work out - body weight resistance 
training. And I felt great doing it. And it doesn't require machines I'm loathe to use in a place I'm loathe to join. 

So for the past week I've added some exercises to my morning routine. A start, a beginning, that I can handle, handle 
knowing that it won't become yet another routine I fail to capture. Agile development for my workout. 

Here are the exercises I currently do in the morning:

1. [22 push-ups](http://22-kill.com)
2. Forward plank: 60 seconds
3. Side planks: 45 seconds each
4. Russian Twists: 50 side to side, 25 each side

Quick, but I feel the strain right away and I interpret that to mean there is benefit. Each day I do them is a reward 
for sticking to it regardless of appearances. 

Thank you Mike.
