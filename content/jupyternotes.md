Title: Self Intro to Jupyter Notebooks

The purpose of this post is to collect my progress on learning how to use [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks. 

The command to open a notebook in the web application is:
```
$ jupyter notebook
```

This will open in the localhost within the directory from which the command was called. Thus, to start with I've created a (git initialized) directory in /home called jupyter-notebooks. Once the web application is opened, a new notebook can be created. I started (obvi) with Hello World:
```
print("Hello World")
```

The notebook can then be saved as an html file. Here's the output:
[Hello World]({filename}./jupyter-notebooks/HelloWorld.md)
