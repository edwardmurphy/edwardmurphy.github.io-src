Title: Self Intro to Jupyter Notebooks
Date: 2016-11-26

The purpose of this post is to collect my progress on learning how to use [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks.

While Jupyter can be installed through the package manager, I've found this to be inconsistent. So, use pip.   

The command to open a notebook in the web application is:
```
$ jupyter notebook
```

Here are some links to useful sites I've come across with Jupyter tips/tricks:
