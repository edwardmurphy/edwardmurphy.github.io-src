In this post I will share the hardware specs for the computers I use at home, as well as operating system and select software details for each system. I am a big fan of virtual machines so I'll be detailing those as well. With this post I'll include some basic code to print hardware specs under various operating systems and terminals. 

I'm writing this post on my Acer Aspire One D255 netbook. At this time of purchase it came pre-loaded with Windows XP. After a few years of use the netbook would no longer boot due to an error in a system configuration file, and the netbook was considered dead. The experts at Best Buy confirmed that there was nothing left to do to resurrect this machine. Given that I'm using it at this current moment that prognosis was incorrect. 

Folks - if you don't have a bootable USB stick with a live version of a linux distribution installed then GET ONE. This device will save your a** and potentially a good deal of money not spent on unnecessary purchases.
